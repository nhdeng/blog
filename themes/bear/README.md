# hexo-theme-bear

此主题参考[Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/)的阅读体验而制作。

This theme is inspired by [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) which is awesome!

## Install

1. Download from GitHub
```shell
$ cd your-hexo-site
$ git clone https://github.com/gary-Shen/hexo-theme-bear themes/bear
```
2. Set the `theme` field in **your site** `_config.yml` to `bear`
```yml
theme: bear
```
3. ❤️ Install dependencies.  
The template is written in pug. So you need to install `hexo-render-pug`.
```
$ npm i hexo-render-pug
# Install your all dependencies if you didn't do this before.
$ npm i
```

## Update

```shell
cd themes/bear
git pull
```
